Hello!

There are two scripts with two Q-learning approaches applied to the Mountain Car problem. One is just Q-table, while another is a DQN. In general, Q-table cannot solve this Markov Decision Problem, but it can do it, if the MDP is modified, for instance, a number of steps in each episode is increased. As expected Q-Network can solve the original problem. These are my very old scripts, but maybe it will help somebody.
